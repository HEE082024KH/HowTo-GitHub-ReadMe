### üìÅ Create the Readme file:
1. In the upper-right corner of any GitHub page, select ```+``` , then click New repository.
2. Make the Repository name the same as your profile name, this makes the Readme file display on your profile.
3. Select Public.
4. Tick the box saying "Add a README file" under "Initialize this repository with".
5. Click Create repository. <br> <br>

- Then go to either your front page or your repositories page, to edit the Readme file. <br> <br>

##### Wonder how I get this line across the screen? Just type ```---``` and it will fill the whole width. You can also use ```***``` and ```___```.

### üñºÔ∏è Header/Images:
To start you might want to have a header or an image. If can get a customized header image like I used above <a href="https://reheader.glitch.me/"> 
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/here-brown" height="15px" alt="Header template"> 
</a> <br>
You can also check out the full GitHub repo if you want more info <a href="https://github.com/khalby786/REHeader?tab=readme-ov-file"> 
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Khalby786-brown" height="15px" alt="Khalby786 Header Guide"> 
</a> <br> <br>

You can use any image you please, as long as you have the URL link. Just put the link inside the ```""``` in this element ```<img src="">```. <br> <br>

If you want to make the image unclickable, ie not redirect to the image when clicked, just surround the picture element with ```<picture>``` tags,
like this 
```<picture> <img src="URL-link"> <picture>```

### üìë About me:
Notice how my headlines are bigger and bolder than the other text? You accomplish this by using ```#``` to ```######```, with ```#``` being the biggest. <br> <br>

A great way to make the text fresh and excicing is by adding icons, like these üíª ü§π. They are stupid easy to get, just start typing ```:``` and you will get a dropdown menu with options.
Some like to sort this section with bullet points, but it's up to you what you prefer.
