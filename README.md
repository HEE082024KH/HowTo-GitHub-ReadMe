### üñºÔ∏è Header/Images:
To start you might want to have a header or an image. If you want a customized header image like I used above, click <a href="https://reheader.glitch.me/"> 
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/here-brown" height="15px" alt="Header template"> 
</a> <br>
You can also check out the full GitHub repo if you want more info <a href="https://github.com/khalby786/REHeader?tab=readme-ov-file"> 
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Khalby786-brown" height="15px" alt="Khalby786 Header Guide"> 
</a> <br> <br>

You can use any image you please, as long as you have the URL link. Just put the link inside the ```""``` in this element ```<img src="">```. <br> <br>

If you want to make the image unclickable, ie not redirect to the image when clicked, just surround the picture element with ```<picture>``` tags,
like this 
```<picture> <img src="URL-link"> <picture>``` <br> <br>

##### Wonder how I got that line across the screen? Just type ```---``` and it will fill the whole width. You can also use ```***``` and ```___```.
